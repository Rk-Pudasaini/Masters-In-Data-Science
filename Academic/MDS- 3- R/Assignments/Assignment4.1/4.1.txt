Use the "mtcars" data and do as follows in R Studio and submit the compiled PDF report file with codes and outputs here:

1. Fit multiple linear regression with mpg as dependent variable and rest of the variables in the mtcars data as independent variables and save it as mlr object 
2. Get the summary of mlr and interpret the result carefully
3. Get the VIF of mlr model and drop variables with VIF > 10 one-by-one until none of the predictors have VIF > 10
4. Fit the mlr model with predictors having VIF <=10, get the summary of mlr and interpret the result carefully
5. Fit lasso regression with mpg as dependent variable and rest of the variables in the mtcars data as independent variables as cv_model object using cv.glmnet model included in the glmnet package
6. Get the best lambda value from the lasso regression fitted above, plot the cv_model and interpret them carefully
7. Fit the best lasso regression model as best_model using the best_lambda value obtained above
8. Get the coefficients of the best_model and identify the important variables with s0 non-missing values
9. Fit the multiple linear regression model using the independent variables obtained from the best_model above
10. Compare the statistically significant variables obtained from step 4 and step 9
11. Write a summary for handling multicollinearity with VIF dropouts and LASSO regression





First check the normality of dependent variable 

# QQ plot
qqnorm(dependent_variable)
qqline(dependent_variable)

Shapiro-Wilk test: Use the Shapiro-Wilk test, which is a common statistical test for normality. The null hypothesis is that the data is normally distributed. If the p-value is greater than the chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05), we do not reject the null hypothesis.

shapiro.test(dependent_variable)

***********************
#Use random seed to replicate the result
set.seed(1234)
#Do random sampling to divide the cases into two independent samples
ind <- sample(2, nrow(mtcars), replace = T, prob = c(0.7, 0.3))
#Data partition
train.data <- data[ind==1,]
test.data <- data[ind==2,]


select(dataframe,-c(column1,column2,.,column n))


Fitting multiple linear regression model using
“mtcars” data:

• mlr <- lm(mpg ~., data = mtcars)

• summary(mlr)

• library(car)

• vif(mlr)

• We need to drop the independent
variable with highest VIF and run the
model again until all the VIF <10!

• None of the variables used in the
model are statistically significant!
> vif(mlr)
