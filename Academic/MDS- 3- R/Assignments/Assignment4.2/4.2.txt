Do as follows in R Studio and submit/attach the compiled PDF report file with codes and outputs here:

1. Generate a 1000 random data with 10 variables [five continuous: age (18 to 90 years), height (150 - 180 cm), weight (50 - 90 kg), income (10000 - 200000), diastolic blood pressure (70 - 170 mm Hg) and five categorical: sex (male/female), education (no education, primary, secondary, tertiary), place of residence (rural/urban), socio-economic status (low/medium/high) and exercise (yes/no)] using set.seed(your roll number and save it as SR object
2. Randomly split the SR object data as SR.train (70%) and SR.test (30%) with replacement sampling and fit multiple linear regression with diastolic blood pressure as dependent variable and rest of variables as independent variable and get fit indices (R-Square, MSE, RMSE and MAE) for the SR.test data
3. Fit the multiple linear regression model with Leave One Out Cross-Validation, k-fold cross validation, repeated k-fold cross validation methods and get fit indices for SR.test data and, compare the fit indices of supervised regression models fitted in step 2 and 3 above with careful interpretation
4. Fit KNN regression, Decision Tree regression, SVM regression and Neural Network regression using the same dependent and independent variables, get and compare fit indices of these models for SR.test data
5. Which supervised regression model is the best model for doing prediction in the SR.test data? Why?
6. Predict diastolic blood pressure of a person with 50 years, 175mm height, 80 kg weight, 90000 income, male, tertiary level education, living in urban area, medium socio-economic status and no exercise and interpret the result carefully
7. Write a reflection of the assignment on your own words focusing on "what did I learn with this assignment?"

Hint: See session 21 and session 22 slides!
