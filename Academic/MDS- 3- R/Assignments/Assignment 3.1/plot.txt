Class work: Assignment 3.1
Locate median graphically for “mpg” variable
• Create a more than cumulative
frequency curve of “mpg” using
cumsum function

• Create a less than cumulative
frequency curve of “mpg” using
cumsum function

• Draw both of them in a single plot

• The point of intersection of more
than and less than cumulative
frequency curve will locate the
“median” value

• Draw a perpendicular to the x-axis
with mpg value from this point of
intersection to find the median

• Compare it with the result of the
“median” function of R!


using the mtcars data set in r. Create a more than cumulative
frequency curve of “mpg” using
cumsum function
